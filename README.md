# Puzzle Tetris Game

## Purpose / Motivation
This is a small game that challenges your spatial thinking and speed of reaction. 

The main target of the game is to allocate the tetrominoes appearing on the screen to some combined outlines at the bottom. 
Each outline corresponds to two shapes of tetrominoes that were merged. 

## How to use
Start the application via ``java -jar Tetris-Puzzle.jar``. Select your preferred settings on the right side and select ``Start``.

### Goal
Fit as many tetrominoes as possible into the tetromino outlines before any tetromino reaches the lower ground of the game grid.
Two tetrominoes combined can fill an outline. Make sure to turn the tetromino into the right position before you insert it.

### Manual
* You can select tetrominoes using your mouse. A selected tetromino turns yellow.
* You can move the tetrominoes around using arrows or the keys ``W`` (up), ``A`` (left), ``S`` (down), ``D`` (right).
* You can turn the tetrominoes using ``C`` (turn right) and ``Y`` (turn left).
* You can mirror the tetrominoes using ``Q`` (horizontally) and ``E`` (vertically)
* You can switch between the tetromino outlines and the "parking slots" where you can temporarily place not fitting tetrominoes by using the key ``V``.
* Select the parking slot or tetromino outlines by pressing the number you see right next to the outline/parking slot.
